# pdfYearJournal

Creating journal through code for my reMarkable2 device.

I once say someone create a PDF journal that had links in the calendar view to the day for that note.  
I didnt know PDF's could do that and I thought that was pretty neat, and here I am trying to create that pdf linking journal for 2022.

The purpose of this PDF is to create a daily writig habit in a simple, easy to use PDF.

Current staus: working.

run: `npm install`
then: `npm install pdfkit`
and finally: `node index.js`
